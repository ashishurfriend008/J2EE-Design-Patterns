>> Iterator pattern is a behavioural design pattern in which an iterator is used to iterate over
object in sequential manner without any need to know the implementation of its underlying data structure.

>> For example, we have different types of collections in our application such as array list, linked list etc.
For which ever type of collection we have we will need to traverse or iterate through the items in the collection.
The actual implementation of how to traverse different type of collections will be different, yet the client code
should not be concerned about the details of the implementations.The iterator pattern helps us to hide such details
and provide a generic interface for the client to traverse different types of collections.
