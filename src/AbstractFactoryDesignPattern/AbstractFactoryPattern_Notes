>> Abstract factory pattern falls under creational design pattern.

>> Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.
This factory is also called as factory of factories.  So at runtime, abstract factory is
coupled with any desired concrete factory which can create objects of desired type.

>> When to use - create a set of related objects or dependent objects which must be used together.
