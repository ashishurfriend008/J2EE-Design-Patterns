>> Strategy design pattern falls under the category of behavioural design pattern.

>> Strategy design pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and
client decides actual implementation to be used at runtime.

>> Strategy pattern attempts to solve the issue where we need to provide multiple solutions for the same
problem so that one can be selected at runtime.

>> In real time example, the distance from Steve's house to airport is 200 kms.There are four transportation
option to go to airport from Steve's house.Steve can use any one option from bus, taxi, train and auto to go airport
based on cost, convenience and time.

>> In the implementation area, context component is composed of strategies and could be anything that would
require changing behaviours.Here, client could tell the context which strategy it would like to use.
